# cpp-academic-projects

This repository contains a collection of academic programming assignments written in C and C++. The projects were developed as part of university courses *Programming 1* and *Programming 2*. Their primary goal was to practice core programming concepts, not to build production-grade applications.

The repository is divided into two main sections:

## Programming 1
Focused on basic procedural programming, data structures, file operations, and simple 3D geometry.

1. operacje-tablicowe.cpp
   
Optimization of element rearrangements in a one-dimensional circular array, including sorting, shifting, and minimal-change configurations.

2. podprogramy-zbiorowe.cpp
   
Integer set manipulations in the range 1â€“4095. Includes union, intersection, difference, harmonic mean, and min/max element queries.

3. szescian-danych.cpp
   
Visualization of 3D objects via parallel projection. Calculates geometric center and renders vertices, edges, and faces.

4. operacje-plikowe.cpp
   
Implementation of a polymorphic stack that supports multiple data types (int, string, float, etc.), with add/remove/read/sort features and file input/output.

---

## Programming 2
Focused on more advanced use of pointers, dynamic memory, bitwise operations, modular code, and OOP.

1. operacje-bitowe.cpp
   
Logical and relational operations on sets of 5-element strings or integer sequences. Includes equality, inclusion, and symmetric difference checks.

2. podprogramy.cpp
   
Modular code for addition and multiplication of arbitrarily large integers. Implemented using overloaded functions across multiple `.cpp` files.

3. tablica-dynamiczna-2D.c
   
Implementation of a fully dynamic two-dimensional array with row/column manipulation, transposition, summing, and memory-safe operations.

4. igrzyska.cpp
   
Object-oriented model with base and derived classes for players (humans/beasts), including health, agility, damage methods, and polymorphic behavior.
